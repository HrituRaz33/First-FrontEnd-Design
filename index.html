                <p style="margin-right: 10%;">One way to come up with a great app idea is to put a twist on an existing idea or try to combine elements from various apps that you like.

                This happens all the time and produces great results!
                    
                For example, Words with Friends, a popular mobile game from Zynga is basically Scrabble but online with social and multiplayer features that makes it easy to play a long game in short pockets of free time.</p>
